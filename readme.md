# dotnet-microservices-checkpoints

Companion repository for the Udemy course **[Master .NET 9 Microservices, Modular Monolith: DDD & Vertical Slice Architecture](https://www.udemy.com/course/net-master-microservices-with-ddd-vertical-architecture/?referralCode=BBB4A0CA199A52D67853)**.

Each commit is a checkpoint — a starting point for the next feature.

## How to use

**Jump to any feature:**
```bash
git log --oneline
git checkout <commit-hash>
```

**Validate your code:**
Compare your implementation against the checkpoint for the feature you just completed.

**Start from a specific section:**
Find the commit for the section you want to start from and checkout.

## Important

This repo is a **learning path**, not meant to run at every checkpoint. Some checkpoints may have incomplete configurations or missing dependencies — that's intentional.

## Looking for a runnable project?

Use the complete repository: [dotnet-microservices](https://github.com/your-username/dotnet-microservices)

Full MVP that compiles and runs — best for debugging, reference, and seeing the complete working system.

## Commit naming convention

`[Module] Feature - OptionalSpecifier`

Examples:
- `[Submission] Create Article`
- `[Auth] Create User - Email Service`

## Status

Work in progress — checkpoints added as I progress through the course.
